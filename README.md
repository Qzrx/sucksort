A really terrible sort implementation. At least it's not bubble sort?
How bad is it?

Sorting random list of size 1     :  1.59740447998e-05 s\n
Sorting random list of size 10    :  5.00679016113e-05 s\n
Sorting random list of size 100   :  0.00125694274902 s\n
Sorting random list of size 1000  :  0.0952899456024 s\n
Sorting random list of size 10000 :  9.05410814285 s\n
Sorting random list of size 100000:  904.841882944 s\n
Finished!

Whoops.
